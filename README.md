Revision control - Yolo Always Does The Right Thing

Yolo matches your workflow, corresponding to the process that you want
to use. The Yolo web site has a catalog of graphically documented 
processes and video tutorials, corresponding to one person casual 
projects, Open Source, medical devices, automotive, and DFARS 204.73.
Under the covers, Yolo is a front-end to git. In some processes 
you can drop down to git if needed, but why? 
Yolo Always Does The Right Thing. 
Itâ€™s the only RCS that is loved by developers, managers, and auditors!

Yolo is implemented in Python.

yolo help init

The following processes have been installed:
 - OPP One Person Project. Like classic RCS, with network backups.
 - gitflow See https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
